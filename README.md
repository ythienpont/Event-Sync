# Event-Sync
This project is an assignment for the Distributed Systems course at UAntwerpen and decomposes a combined Google Calendar and Facebook Events application into microservices, focusing on grouping related functionality to ensure scalability and graceful failure. Each service communicates efficiently, minimizing the impact on the entire application when a single service fails.

The report and it's LaTeX source are stored in `report\`.

Note that a mock .env is included.
